Adds to Gravity Forms the capability to turn off autocomplete on a given form or form input.

== Description ==

This plugin extends Gravity Forms to give you the ability to turn auto complete off on an entire form or a given form field.

This plugin was created because of the need to turn auto complete off on password fields in gravity forms due to a need to pass a security audit.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Enable autocomplete off
	- Go to a Gravity Form -> Form Settings to set autocomplete off for the entire form
	- Go to a Gravity Form -> Edit Field -> Advanced Tab to set autocomplete off for that form field
